# CRAP Framework

This project, CRAP (which stands for Core for Rapid Application Prototyping), is
a collection of utility and helper for creating applications in a browser
environment (or nodejs for most of it). This includes:

- a lightweight ORM
- an adapter for using indexedDB
- a widget system
- widgets to view and edit data

The plan is to include these files/features:

- tasks
- concurrency
- utils (?)
- widget
- datastore
- fields
- types
- loader
- indexeddb
- model
- qweb
- views
- router
- domain
